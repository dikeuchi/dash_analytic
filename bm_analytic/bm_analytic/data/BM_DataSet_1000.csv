It is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC, including CMOS Image Sensors. It was founded in February of 1983. The company has a registered office located in Icheon-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.Since pilot production of Korea's first 16Kb SRAM in 1984, the company consistently led the industry with smaller, faster and lower power semiconductor. It is the second largest manufacturer of memory semiconductor and the largest DRAM provider in emerging markets, such as China.Through its tireless focus on R&D and quality control, the company manufactures highest quality and highest performance DRAM products. Its principal products include dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) for PCs, laptops and servers, low-power mobile DRAMs, high-speed graphic DRAMs for graphic data processing and consumer DRAMs for the full spectrum of digital devices. Its products support wide array of interfaces, including DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 interfaces, to meet customer needs.After launching its initial NAND flash business in 2003, the company successfully developed 512Mb NAND flash memory in February 2004 and achieved a double-digit global market share in 2005. This remarkable performance is the result of intensive R&D and aggressive marketing. While NAND flash was initially used for simple data storage in MP3 players, PMPs, digital cameras and navigational devices, its applications have since expanded to include smartphones, tablet PCs and solid state drives (SSD). As the technology and market share leader, it is staying ahead of rapid NAND flash industry developments through introduction of higher-speed, higher-capacity products.The company's single-level cell (SLC), multi-level cell (MLC) and leading-edge triple-level cell (TLC) products come in wide range of capacities from 128Mb to 512Gb.

Headquartered in Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation, the company was created under the name Sibneft in 1995 by a presidential decree. The company is involved in the production, exploration and distribution of gas and oil products in the Russian Federation and internationally. It is the fifth largest oil producing and refining company in Russia and the largest employer in Omsk and Noyabrsk. The company and its producing subsidiaries hold about 45 oilfield exploration and development licenses in the Yamal-Nenets and Khanti-Mansiisk autonomous regions (in the West Siberian petroleum basin), as well as in the Omsk and Tomsk regions and in Chukotka. About 80 percent of its total oil reserves are concentrated in the Noyabrsk area (including the Meretoyahaneftegas subsidiary), and four out of the company's five largest fields are licensed to Sibneft-Noyabrskneftegas (the Sugmutskoye, Sutorminskoye, Vyngapurovskoye and Sporyshevskoye oilfields) which account for about 46 percent of Sibneft's reserves. Furthermore, the Priobskoye field is among the company's most promising oil fields, and its development license is held by the Sibneft-Yugra subsidiary.The company's main oil processing center is the Omsk Refinery in southwestern Siberia. It also owns approximately 38 percent of the Moscow Refinery, with access to a corresponding share of the facility's capacity, and has access to processing at Slavneft's Yaroslavlnefteorgsintez (YaNOS) and Mendeleyev Refineries in Yaroslavl, as well as the Mozyr Refinery in the Republic of Belarus.All of its export operations are handled by its wholly-owned subsidiary Sibneft Oil Trade (Siboil). Siboil was established in 2000 in line with its strategy to consolidate various parts of its business into a fully integrated company with the goal of streamlining export operations and improving corporate transparency. Siboil buys and resells oil from the company and from other oil companies as well. The company generally ships its oil exports through the seaports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse on the Black Sea, the port of Primorsk on the Baltic Sea and also to Germany and Poland via the Druzhba pipeline. In 2004, the company exported more than one (1) million tons of crude to China by rail both directly and through Kazakhstan.The company ships approximately two-thirds of its oil exports via sea terminals. Through Tuapse, the company exports Siberian Light oil, which is higher in quality than the Urals blend which makes up much of Russia's exports. Siberian Light trades at an average premium of 5 percent over Urals. In addition, small volumes of export deliveries are sent via railway to China and Estonia. The company also deliveries crude oil to countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States, specifically in 2002, when the company boosted exports mainly to the Mozyr refinery in the Republic of Belarus and the Pavlodar refinery in Kazakhstan.As of the end of 2004, it had retail subsidiaries in key regions of Western Siberia such as Omsk, Tyumen, Kemerovo, Sverdlovsk, Tomsk, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Altay and Noyabrsk. It also distributes in the Kaluga, Ivanovo, Yaroslavl and Kostroma regions as well as the city of Saint-Petersburg. The majority of its gasoline filling stations also feature a mini-mart. In these stores, consumers can purchase spare parts, motor oils, food and other items, with the assortment of goods depending on the season and location. Some of its stations are equipped with carwashes, cafes and repair stations. In 2004, it opened its first multi-fuel filling station in Tyumen, offering traditional gasoline together with compressed automotive gas.",Operates as a vertically-integrated oil company,"",Manufacturing,"",Gas and oil products,1.73610504716635e-002,0.01648616977036,1.37206772342324e-002,1.77751239389181e-002,3.05537562817335e-002,3.29243019223213e-002,3.10596618801355e-002,3.2811626791954e-002,3.30641902983189e-002,3.40362973511219e-002,RUB,118322000,100701000,102378000,102658000,90223000,91214000,75435463.819,56748176.852,52534176.229,36901781.267,100191000,108955000,87987000,95471000,85869000,64631000,57019294.248,38401021.93,36595482.577,22299722.916,118151000,78161000,76372000,65624000,61003000,46269000,31584374.736,25996882.307,28520281.05,15013383.939,2052275000,1726345000,1587653000,1293800000,895543000,758212000,621803291.824,485011002.377,431433519.808,269388879.331,1857931000,1546128000,1484054000,1408238000,1267603000,1232649000,1422166157.844,999066587.215,745096122.957,974371555.692,1857931000,1545608000,1467943000,1408238000,1267603000,1232649000,1422166157.844,998792294.201,730881348.733,971756700.172,672567000,553156000,560176000,554216000,463603000,467092000,366777978.587,240372111.081,179015422.625,257666100.091,1185364000,992972000,923878000,854022000,804000000,765557000,1055388179.257,758694476.133,566080700.333,716705455.601,741843000,631247000,603221000,546955000,498788000,460433000,767490647.258,560136811.153,392841919.999,480075721.264,140998000,129845000,114083000,90067000,76785000,69163000,63200945.573,49342265.48,44610195.704,38458942.42,302523000,231880000,206574000,217000000,228427000,235961000,224696586.426,149215399.5,128628584.63,198170791.917,963000,1195000,922000,936000,2876000,3431000,2382511.448,2773407.139,4445897.47,5670417.026,C2,Created under the name Sibneft by a presidential decree,The fifth largest oil producing and refining company in Russia and the largest employer in Omsk and Noyabrsk,,,,,Russian Federation,Germany; Poland; China; Estonia; Republic of Belarus; Kazakhstan,,Russian Federation and internationally,,,No,0.162827898344987,0.149974646342347,0.139195743551111,0.154093271165811,0.180203896645874,0.191425945260979,0.157996015575732,0.149354809188398,0.172633544407026,0.140027512735749,0.130415611178352,0.12218773142288,0.133518906154053,0.152688782978951,0.160669612763089,0.136439170299891,0.1299466518036,0.147218664543937,883804000,762287000,718226000,637958000,578449000,533027000,833074104.279,612252483.772,441898013.173,1.34120687392227,1.30262224070462,1.28633327114307,1.3386806027983,1.38992374435776,1.43624431783005,1.26685990338207,1.23918562397459,1.28102114845079

In addition, all used vehicles are thoroughly reconditioned to meet mechanical, electrical, safety, and cosmetic standards, thus each vehicle must pass an inspection before being trade. It was formed in 1993 as part of Circuit City, the third largest consumer electronics retailer in the United States. Based in Richmond, Virginia, the company is the largest retailer of used car in the USA. Furthermore, the company is a Fortune 500 (a ranking of the top 500 American public corporations) company and has been named America's Most Admired Company in Automotive Retailing by Fortune magazine. As a used car retailer, the company aims to build customer satisfaction by offering high-quality vehicles; therefore, fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through the appraisal process meet its standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale. While selling used cars was always the target business, it also has also obtained the rights to sell new cars made by brands such as Chevrolet, Chysler, Dodge, Jeep, Nissan, Scion and Toyota. Furthermore, the company also operates an auto finance division which helps clients out by providing prime auto loans for new and used car sales. The company operates over 80 used car superstores and more than seven new car franchises, all of which are integrated or co-located with its used car superstores. The company's trademarks include the following: Carmax, Carmax The Auto Superstore, The Carmax Advantage, 5 Day More Money Back Guarantee, Valumax, and Carmax.com. Aside from its retail activities, it also operates the Carmax Foundation, which was established in 2003. Carmax Foundation donates to charities and causes in communities in near locations through donations, grants, service projects, and matching gifts The company outlets can be found at the following states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.",Involved in the operation of a chain of used vehicles outlets in United States,"",Retail,"",Operation of a chain of used vehicles outlets in United States,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,USD,2390694,2260563,1932029,2086874,1641424,1517813,1092592,1049477,843133,703157,133321,152388,132171,137690,79923,91961,86434,119597,99434,75876,529634,494480,433722,453746,426141,336204,324827,269763,253267,237312,2667061,2518393,2161698,1862538,1652977,1428970,1278722,1175317,893453,938259,17120209,15875118,15149675,14268716,12574299,10962818,10003599,8975554,7470193,6973966,17120209,15875118,15149675,14268716,12574299,10962818,10003599,8975554,7470193,6973966,14611408,13522949,12993555,12266016,10823687,9403173,8542026,7598005,6296095,5951055,2508801,2352169,2156120,2002700,1750612,1559645,1461573,1377549,1174098,1022911,1615688,1489457,1364494,1261017,1156712,1029921,940786,878805,792201,882358,179942,168875,137360,115173,101911,95283,82812,76321,75228,54741,713171,693837,654266,626510,491989,434441,437975,422423,306669,85812,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,C1,"Formed as part of Circuit City, the third largest consumer electronics retailer in the United States",Largest retailer of used car in the USA,Aims to build customer satisfaction by offering high-quality vehicles,,,,United States of America,,,Richmond,,,No,4.16566760370741e-002,4.3705942847165e-002,4.31868010369859e-002,4.39079451858177e-002,3.91265548878709e-002,3.96285881969399e-002,4.3781742950712e-002,4.70637244230273e-002,4.10523529981086e-002,3.99907925474588e-002,4.18757248118545e-002,4.13989143593993e-002,4.20611275048798e-002,3.76533105653266e-002,3.81180246934811e-002,4.19453044148325e-002,4.49482904671931e-002,3.94335144432292e-002,1795630,1658332,1501854,1376190,1258623,1125204,1023598,955126,867429,1.39717035246682,1.41839450725187,1.43563888367311,1.45524963849468,1.39089465233036,1.38609976502039,1.42787793645552,1.44226939691727,1.3535378688054
